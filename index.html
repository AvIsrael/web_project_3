                            shores of
                            the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in the river, unless they
                            grew up here, in which case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot here,
                            and
                            the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.</p>
                        <p class="places__paragraph">The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet
                            architecture, all of it
                            sprinkled
                            with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the landscape is
                            difficult
                            to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing heels. The left bank is considered far
                            less
                            interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live on the far outskirts of the

                            rock that juts out into the sea. It is thought to have been built by Llewelyn the Great in
                            the
                            13th century. Some 900 years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of
                            Snowdonia
                            has become a popular tourist destination during the summer months.</p>
                        <p class="places__paragraph">A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the

                            Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another
                            claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for five years in a row
                            for its spectacular floral displays around town. It was also home to David Lloyd George, the

                            is surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside. It's known as the arts and crafts

                            the state, and visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops with handmade

                            candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios, and more. The town holds a yearly festival

                            and was the first college in the south to be racially integrated, as well as the first to be
                            coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no tuition — every student receives a

                            Muramvya was the royal capital and in 2007, because of its cultural and natural landscape,
                            it
                            was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. It is located in the center of
                            Burundi,
                            between the country's political and economic capitals</p>

                            would think you're in heaven.
                            At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the
                            province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest plantations of tea and coffee
                            in the country, which make up the bulk of Burundi's exports.</p>
                        <p class="places__paragraph">The Kibira National Park, one of the largest wildlife reserves for
                            apes, overlaps four
                            provinces, including Muramvya. This National Park lies at the apex of the beautiful
                            mountains of the Congo-Nile Divide, ranging between 1550 and 2660 meters of altitude. It is
                            filled with beautiful vegetation, and a source for the various rivers and streams which
                            provide water around the country.</p>
